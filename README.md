Run_Sim_Base_Case execute 10 simulation runs (each of 4 simulated years) of a urban network made of square grid 
composed of 18 Ã— 18 = 324 equally spaced nodes, each positioned 150 meters apart from its neighbouring nodes  
each node is populated, on average, with 80 citizens. Also more green-oriented citizens are concentrated in the center, whereas
the less green oriented ones are concentrated in the suburb.
The waste collection network is made of 16 bins (arranged as a two concentric rings) and 2 trucks that collect waste 2 times per months.
The system is dimensioned to fulfill the average demand, but it fails to managed the extra waste generation during high-seasonal periods.
